# Software Engineering Project ðŸ’»

One Paragraph of the project(description)

## Getting Started

Our application uses Turbo.js to get both front-end and back-end on a single repository, so don't worry about 
setting backend before you can run it locally, simply run npm i and then turbo run dev at the outher folder and 
you're good to go =)

### Prerequisites

To run our app locally you need node only

### Installing

npm run install
turbo run dev

## Running the tests

jest run tests

### Sample Tests

So far we're testing if the app running can acess all endpoints of the app (get iniciatives, post them, patch/update and so on)

### Style test

Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.

    our app is developed following two main design principles: modularization through components for the front-end part and 
    factorization of the functions at the backe-end side. 

## Deployment

through turbo we've turbo run build to facilitate testing the deployment

## Built With

  - React.ts, Nest.ts, Postgres and (futurely) Docker
  - MIT license

## Contributing

if you want to contribute, be sure to fork and write clean code so we can review and push it to production =)
